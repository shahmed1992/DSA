Agenda:
    1. What is an Array?
    2. When and where is a Array used?
    3. Complexity
    4. Static array usage example
    5. Dynamic Array Implementation details
    6. Code Implementation

Static Array:
    1. A static array is a fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range[0, n-1]
    2. Contigous memory assignment in static array

When and where is a static array used?
    1. storing and accessing sequential data
    2. Temp storing objects
    3. used by IO routines as buffers
    4. Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
    5. can be used to return multiple values from a function
    6. Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to sub-problems.
        knapsack

Complexity:
                Static Array        Dynamic Array
Access:            O(1)                 O(1)
Search:            O(n)                 O(n)
Insertion:         N/A                  O(n)
Appending:         N/A                  O(1)
Deletion:          N/A                  O(n)

Dynamic Array:
    1. How can we implement a dynamic array?
        One way is to use a static array
